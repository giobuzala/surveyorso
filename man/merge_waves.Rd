\usage{
merge_waves(
  new_data,
  old_data,
  vars = c("New and shared old", "All"),
  keep_old = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_data}{A data frame for the new wave.}

\item{old_data}{A data frame for the old wave.}

\item{vars}{Character string, either \code{"New and shared old"} (default) or \code{"All"}.}

\item{keep_old}{(Optional) character vector of old-only variables to keep when \code{vars = "New and shared old"}.}
}
\value{
A merged data frame with harmonized variable labels.
}
\description{
This function merges a new survey wave into an old one while preserving variable labels and allowing flexible control over which variables are retained.

It provides two options for which variables to retain:
\itemize{
\item \code{"New and shared old"} (default): keeps all variables from the new dataset, plus shared variables from the old dataset, and any additional old-only variables specified in \code{keep_old}.
\item \code{"All"}: keeps all variables from both datasets.
}

Variable labels are reapplied after merging:
\itemize{
\item For variables present in the new dataset, labels are taken from \code{new_data}.
\item For old-only variables (when included), labels are taken from \code{old_data}.
}
}
\examples{
# Merge new data and shared variables from old data
merged_data <- merge_waves(new_data = new_data, old_data = old_data, vars = "New and shared old")

}
