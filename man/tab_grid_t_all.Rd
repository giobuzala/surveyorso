\title{\strong{Apply \code{tab_grid_t()} to all grid questions}}
\usage{
tab_grid_t_all(data, y = NULL, weight = NULL, exclude = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the survey data.}

\item{y}{(Optional) A variable to cross-tabulate against a grid set. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{weight}{(Optional) A numeric weighting variable. If \code{NULL} (default), results are unweighted.}

\item{exclude}{Variables to exclude from tabulation. Defaults to \code{NULL}. Always excludes \code{y} (if specified), \code{weight} (if specified), and variable literally named "weight".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{tab_grid_t()}.}
}
\value{
A named list of frequency tables or crosstabs, one per grid question prefix.
}
\description{
This function maps \code{tab_grid_t()} across all grid question prefixes in a data frame.
Optionally, you can specify a \code{y} variable for crosstabs and/or exclude prefixes from being tabulated.
Additional arguments are passed to \code{tab_grid_t()}.

Grid questions are detected automatically by prefixes before the first underscore (\verb{_}).
Multiple response (pick-any) sets are skipped, since those should be handled with \code{tab_mr()}.
}
\examples{
# Frequency tables of all grid questions
tab_grid_t_all(data = survey_data)

# Weighted crosstabs of all grid questions by region, excluding Q99
tab_grid_t_all(data = survey_data, y = region, weight = weight_var, exclude = "Q99")
}
