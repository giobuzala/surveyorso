\usage{
tab_grid_all(data, weight = NULL, exclude = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the survey data.}

\item{weight}{(Optional) A numeric weighting variable. If \code{NULL} (default), results are unweighted.}

\item{exclude}{Variables or prefixes to exclude from tabulation. Defaults to \code{NULL}.  Always excludes \code{weight} (if specified) and any variable literally named "weight".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{tab_grid()}.}
}
\value{
A named list of grid frequency tables, one per grid questions prefix.
}
\description{
This function maps \code{tab_grid()} across all grid question prefixes in a data frame.
Additional arguments are passed to \code{tab_grid()}.

Grid questions are detected automatically by prefixes before the first underscore (\verb{_}).
Multiple response (pick-any) sets are skipped, since those should be handled with \code{tab_mr()}.
}
\examples{
# Unweighted frequency tables of all grid questions
tab_grid_all(data = survey_data)

# Weighted frequency tables of all grid questions, excluding Q99
tab_grid_all(data = survey_data, weight = weight_var, exclude = "Q99")
}
