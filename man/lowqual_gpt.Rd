\usage{
lowqual_gpt(data, x, batch_size = 100, model = "gpt-4o")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the survey data.}

\item{x}{The open-ended variable to evaluate for response quality.}

\item{batch_size}{Integer; number of responses per API call. Defaults to \code{100}.}

\item{model}{Character string; the OpenAI model to use. Defaults to \verb{gpt-4o}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with an additional variable named \code{x_lowqual} containing the classification results.
}
\description{
This function flags low-quality open-ended survey responses using the OpenAI API.
Responses are evaluated for signs of gibberish, nonsense, random text, irrelevant words, or other indicators of poor data quality.
}
\details{
Requires an OpenAI API key, which can be generated at \verb{https://platform.openai.com/}, to be set in your R session using \code{Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY="...")}.

The model classifies each response as low-quality (\code{1}) or valid (\code{0}).

A response is flagged as low-quality if it is:
\itemize{
\item Gibberish or random characters
\item Off-topic or meaningless
\item Contains only emojis or irrelevant text
}

A response is considered valid if it is interpretable, relevant, and meaningful.

The function appends a new column to the dataset with the results.

\examples{
# Identify low-quality respondents in question Q5
data <- lowqual_gpt(data = survey_data, x = Q5)
