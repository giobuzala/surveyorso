\title{\strong{Normalize numeric and factor variables to a 0–1 scale}}
\usage{
normalize(
  data,
  vars = everything(),
  flip = FALSE,
  keep_all = TRUE,
  outside_scale = c("Don't know", "Prefer not to say")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing variables to normalize.}

\item{vars}{Variables to normalize. Supports tidyselect syntax (e.g., \code{starts_with()}, \code{c(var1, var2)}).}

\item{flip}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, reverses the direction of valid response levels before scaling.}

\item{keep_all}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, returns full dataset; if \code{FALSE}, returns only normalized variables.}

\item{outside_scale}{Character vector of response levels (typically DK/PNS) that lie outside of the scale and should be treated as neutral midpoint (\code{0.5}).}
}
\value{
A data frame with normalized variables.
\itemize{
\item If \code{keep_all = TRUE}, the full dataset is returned with normalized variables.
\item If \code{keep_all = FALSE}, only normalized variables are returned.
}
}
\description{
This function rescales variables to the 0 to 1 range. It supports flipping of scales and preserves variable labels.
}
\details{
Numeric variables are min–max scaled to 0 to 1.

Factor variables are converted to numeric order and evenly spaced between 0 and 1.

Levels listed in \code{outside_scale} (e.g., "Don't know") are assigned a value of 0.5.
}
\examples{
# Normalize Q1 and Q2 with flipping the scale order
normalize(data = data, vars = c(Q2, Q3), flip = TRUE)
