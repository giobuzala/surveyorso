\usage{
export_coding(data, x, path = "Data", filter = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the survey responses. Must include a \code{Vrid} column and the variables specified in \code{x}.}

\item{x}{A single variable or multiple variables specifying the open-ended question(s) to export.}

\item{path}{File path where the workbook(s) will be saved. Defaults to \code{"Data"}.}

\item{filter}{(Optional) A single variable used to group or filter responses in the exported workbook.}
}
\value{
One or more Excel workbooks saved to the specified path.
}
\description{
This function creates an Excel-based coding workbook for open-ended survey questions.
\itemize{
\item To export a workbook for a single variable, set \code{x = var}.
\item To export for multiple variables at once, provide a vector, e.g., \code{x = c(var1, var2, var3)}.
\item Optionally, you can include a \code{filter} variable that will appear in the workbook for easier sorting or filtering.
}
}
\details{
Each workbook includes:
\itemize{
\item A \verb{Coding Workbook} sheet containing responses, along with columns for codes and bins.
\item A \code{Codes} sheet pre-populated with standard codes (97 = "Other", 98 = "None", 99 = "Don't know") and space for custom codes.
}

The workbook also includes Excel formulas for bin lookups, counts, and percentages, with conditional formatting to highlight invalid codes.

\strong{NOTE:} The formula in cell D2 of the first sheet must be filled down to the end of the column. Copying the formula programmatically in R causes Excel to become slow.
}
\examples{
# Export coding workbook for Q5
export_coding(data = survey_data, x = Q5)

# Export separate coding workbooks for Q5 and Q6
export_coding(data = survey_data, x = c(Q5, Q6))

}
