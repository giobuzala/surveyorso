# surveyorso

`surveyorso` is an R package providing a unified toolkit for end-to-end survey research workflows.

It is designed for applied survey analysts who want fast, consistent, and reproducible ways to clean data, manage metadata, tabulate results, run advanced analytics, and prepare outputs for reporting, with built-in support for SPSS-style metadata such as data types, variable labels, and value levels.

`surveyorso` is intentionally opinionated. While it reflects common survey research workflows, it may require customization for specific projects. The package is designed to be forked, extended, and adapted to fit different survey research environments.

## Status and Installation

The package is currently under active development and installed from GitHub:
```
devtools::install_github("giobuzala/surveyorso")
```
Function interfaces may change, and documentation is evolving alongside the codebase.

## Documentation

All functions are documented using `roxygen2`. Longer workflows will be added as vignettes over time.
